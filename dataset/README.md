# 📚 SciFigSeg Dataset

In the revised version, we have added a dedicated section titled “SciFigSeg Dataset”. Illustrations were automatically extracted from arXiv papers using pdffigures2, followed by manual filtering to retain complex illustrations, such as multi-stage frameworks, and system pipelines. We define a subregion as a visually and semantically independent and complete area, typically representing a functional module or a processing stage. Such regions often exhibit a consistent background color or a clearly defined outer boundary. Notably, arrows, connecting lines, and decorative elements are excluded from annotation. Ground truth annotations were created independently of our proposed method to avoid bias. We also clarify all illustration categories in the dataset. The “Other” category in Table 1 refers to hybrid diagram styles that do not strictly fit the flowchart or composite panel classification. We believe these revisions address the concerns regarding the transparency, and applicability of our dataset.
